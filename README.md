# workday-scheduler
The user is presented with a scheduler that has 9 text inputs, one for each hour and has the live date at the top. 

The text input fields change color with the hour to keep the user on track.

This website will save the user's schedule they've input when the blue save icon is clicked. It maintains a copy on local storage in case they close the window and need to come back to it.
